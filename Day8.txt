Routing / Navigation system in React

the react-router-dom library, how it works and how to pass query parameters

To provide a richer user experience and properly dividing our content we need to divide our components in different routes, like traditional HTML structure
We'll actually never load a different page 
will give the feeling of an instant browsing 
You will be able to implement the react-router-dom library in your project and create a SPA

Fetch parameters in the URl and get them back 

react-router-dom

npm install react-router-dom

for loading a specific component on a specific route, we will need a Route component from react-router-dom 

import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
//renaming it
for putting Route components into our app, they need their own to be wrapped inside a Router

<Router>
.....
<Route path="/" exact={true} component={Home}/>
<Route path="/reservations" exact component={Reservations}/>
</Router>                   
//wrapp the component
exact === exact={true}

route is taking our component as a prop, and returning something new 
HOC - High-order component

history, location and match are additional props given to wrapped components
thanks to the Route component

export default withRouter(MyNavbar)
the result withRouter(MyNavbar) is a HOC
//we are exporting the result value from withRouter
//If you pass a component into the component prop of a Route we're achiving two things
1) we're mounting that component just on the specified path 
2) we're enriching the said component with history , location and match 

if you just want 2), you can wrap its export withRouter function just like we did with MyNavbar 

render={(routerProps) => <Home subTitle="WE can..."/>}
//the render prop takes a function and returns a component tag
{...routerProps}

but now this component is not receiving automatically history, location and match anymore, luckly, those props are safely stored in the only argument of the function , render is accepting
so we can safely spread the content of the parameter in the props of our component

MyNavbar = ({brand, history, Location, match}) => ...(..)

two ways for redirecting the user
1)Using a <link /> component
2)Using history.push()

<Link to="/reservations">
<div className="nav-link active" >Reservations </div>
</Link>

<Route component={() => <h1>404</h1>}/>
//fallback 
//the Switch statement will stop whenever a specific route is found 
//it's the simplest way of defining a fallback case for displaying like a 404 page when the url does not match any routes
//<Switch></Switch>

className={location.pathName ==='/reservations' ? 'nav-link active' : 'nav-link'}


history.push()
<Nav.Link onClick={() => history.push('/menu')}>Menu</Nav.Link>
//you can go back to the previous page
<Nav.Link onClick={() => history.replace('/menu')}>Menu</Nav.Link>
//remove the element from the history 

create Menu component that will load on another Route

<Route path="/menu" exact component="{Menu}" />

import items from '../data/menu.json'

const Menu = () => (
	<Container>
		{
			items.map(dish =>(
				<Row key={dish.id}
					<Col md={8}>
						<img src={dish.image} alt="..."/>
						<h4>
							{dish.name}
							<Badge variant="danger">{dish.price}</Badge>
							<Badge variant="info">{dish.label}</Badge>		
						</h4>
					</Col>
				</Row>
			))
		}
	</Container>
)

dynamic routes
<Route path='/details/:pastaID/' component={DishDetails} />
//valid routes can be /details/0, /details/strive, /details/whatever
